Update UI using service   

The project guides how to interact with UI using service.

It takes an example of a timer (of 10 sec) which updates UI continiously after every second. 
The timer runs as a Service and is implemented using directly SERVICE INSTANCE and CALLBACKS ( by using callback Interface).
